When we initialize a repository , it is kind of a whole project set.It contains
all the necessary files to be present in ordet to operate the whole project.
after intialization of a repository , git creates  a .git files which contains
all the metadata about the code revision history of the projects and it's hidden
because user doesn't really needs to know about all these to do his work.

staging area is characteristic feature of git , it provides more control over
your files and the changes you want to do to your files. In addition to this
it will act as a intermediate between working directory and git repository.
when we perform git commit it saves all files from staging area to the repository.
it provides a better way to track changes into your files for an instance ,to 
commit according to some logical change so that in each commit you will have
manageable amount of changes made into your files.
