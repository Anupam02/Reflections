When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

first of all , I might not always want to pull changes manually rather than 
having git automatically stay up-to-date with my remote repository. nut if 
I do then the main reason behind that would be to save my files directly 
into cloud and to ensure that my data will always be there.

to be frank I don't think I got this question completely.


branch is for experimental trials in which one master branch is the working
branch without any glitch wherease others are experimental and if successful
then can be merged with the master branch in a repository.
forks and clones are quite confusing but a simple way to differentiate between
both of them is that : fork operates in github repository from one account to 
another, while clone is simply making copies of github repository to local
disk or local disk to local disk(as shown in the quiz).

having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally will help 
to ensure the location of master/origin branch so that we could make decisions
regarding the merging branches to the github and how it has changed.

without using git or github it is very difficult to collaborate to large mass
of people because these have to be done with manually or by other version-control
system.well I have no Idea about the other version control systems so as far
as I know it would be total mess to work with lot of people throgh sharing 
your files through other media ftp or drive , dropbox or other things. 
the biggest problem would lies in the merging and branching in this case.

I want to make changes in a seperate branch rather than directly in master when
I want to do some experiments on my project or we can say to have have a different flavors trial to my project.
This approach have a benefit that in case of any trouble into my experimental
branches I have my perfect working master branch always there for me(error free).
