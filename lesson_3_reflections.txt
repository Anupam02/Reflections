When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

first of all , I might not always want to pull changes manually rather than 
having git automatically stay up-to-date with my remote repository. nut if 
I do then the main reason behind that would be to save my files directly 
into cloud and to ensure that my data will always be there.

to be frank I don't think I got this question completely.


branch is for experimental trials in which one master branch is the working
branch without any glitch wherease others are experimental and if successful
then can be merged with the master branch in a repository.
forks and clones are quite confusing but a simple way to differentiate between
both of them is that : fork operates in github repository from one account to 
another, while clone is simply making copies of github repository to local
disk or local disk to local disk(as shown in the quiz).
